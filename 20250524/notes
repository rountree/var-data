Idle measurement at different sampling rates.

job.out erroneously reports duration as 10h.

mperf isn't reliable under lots of idle time and tsc wasn't included.
This isn't worth trying to correct.  Re-run with tsc.

No OP_TSC or DELTA_TSC specified on command line, but empty tsc and dtsc files generated.
